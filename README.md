## My resume, inspired by "The Cloud Resume Challenge" - made in Azure using Terraform as much as possible

No prior experience with HTML, CSS or JS - The webpage will most likely be a template, which I will edit to my liking as we go and learn.

## Summary:

* Created a static website using HTML and styled it with CSS.
* Hosted the website on Azure Storage as a static website, ensuring cost-effective and scalable hosting.
* Utilized Terraform to deploy, set up, and manage the Azure infrastructure; Storage Account (static website, container etc), CosmosDB (account, database, container etc), Function App + App Service Plan, Application Insights, CDN (profile, endpoint, custom domain) and more.
* Created an Azure Function API to handle HTTP triggers, enabling the updating of visitor counts stored in Cosmos DB, and returning the count to the webpage.
* Created a JavaScript visitor counter on the webpage, which interacts with the API to fetch and display the count.
* Leveraged Azure CDN for caching, HTTPS, and custom domain mapping, enhancing website performance and security.

*I'm not quite done with this project yet, I will return to work on it and make further improvements.*
